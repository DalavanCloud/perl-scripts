Perl scripts
=========================
Assortment of Perl scripts that run on the command line, i.e. **Terminal** on macOS, and **Command Prompt** on Windows.

Installation
-----
**macOS**: A version of Perl is already installed.

**Windows**: You may need to install one of the versions available at [perl.org](http://www.perl.org/get.html).

Dependencies
-----
Some of the scripts may depend on certain tools being installed and appropriately configured to run on the command line. Such dependencies are stated in the comments section at the beginning of each script.
Here is a list of the locations from which you may need to get the extra tools and packages:

* [Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType (AFDKO)](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html) for spot and tx
* Adobe Acrobat Distiller

Using the scripts
-----
1. Download the [ZIP package](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/perl-scripts/archive/master.zip) and unzip it.
2. 
 * All of the scripts can be run by simply typing `perl ` followed by the file name of the script, e.g. `perl theScript.pl`.
 * If the script is in a different directory from which you are trying to run it, you will need to provide the full path to the script's file, such as `perl /Users/myself/foldername/theScript.pl`.
 * Some scripts may allow you to use options, or require that you provide input files. To learn how to use those scripts, open them in a text editor app (e.g. TextEdit, Notepad) and read the documentation near the top of the file.
